However, there is a lack of evidence on the efficacy of VR relaxation interventions to reduce anxiety in athletes and how that is portrayed in their movement patterns. The purpose of the current study was to examine how a VR relaxation intervention affected perceived anxiety levels and penalty kick performance of female soccer players.</p>

It is also for those who don't want to move at all and just want to be lazy and play their favourite sport or follow their program.</p>
